            <ol>
                <li>Mince the garlic and onion with a knife</li>
                <li>Saute the vegetables with a third part of olive oil for one part of rice, in a pot</li>
                <li>Add 2 parts of water for 1 part of rice on the pot and put it on mid fire</li>
                <li>Add salt to the water until it tastes like simple broth until it starts boiling</li>
                <li>Add the rice to the broth and let it boil until the water evaporates juste enough so the top of the rice is out of the water</li>
                <li>Stir the rice carefully so it cooks evenly but do not stir it too much, just one time</li>
                <li>Put the fire on the minimum, cover it and let it dry slowly</li>
                <li>Be wary to not let it dry too much so it starts to burn on the bottom</li>
                <li>Serve hot on the plate</li>
